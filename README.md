README

Part 1: Classification and Regression

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

   - Use web scraping libraries (Scrapy or BeautifulSoup) to collect Arabic text data from several websites related to a specific topic.
   - Prepare the dataset with the format: `Text (Arabic Language), Score`, where the score represents the relevance of the text (ranging from 0 to 10).
   - Establish an NLP preprocessing pipeline for the collected dataset, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal, and discretization.

2. Model Training:

   - Train models using RNN, Bidirectional RNN, GRU, and LSTM architectures.
   - Tune the hyperparameters to obtain the best performance.

3. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the four language models using standard metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Additionally, evaluate the models using the BLEU score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) or other relevant metrics.

Part 2: Transformer (Text Generation)

1. Model Fine-tuning:

   - Install the `pytorch-transformers` library.
   - Load the pre-trained GPT-2 model.
   - Fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-2 model on a custom dataset (you can generate your own dataset).

2. Text Generation:
   - Use the fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate a new paragraph based on a given sentence.

Part 3: BERT

1. Dataset:

   - Use the Amazon Review dataset available at https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html.

2. Model Setup:

   - Establish the model using the pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` model.
   - Prepare the data and adapt the BERT embedding layer.

3. Model Training:

   - Fine-tune and train the model by choosing the best hyperparameters to obtain an efficient model.

4. Model Evaluation:

   - Evaluate the model using standard metrics (accuracy, loss, F1-score).
   - Additionally, evaluate the model using other metrics like BLEU score, BERT metric, etc.

5. Conclusion:
   - Provide a general conclusion regarding the use of the pre-trained BERT model, highlighting its strengths, limitations, and potential improvements.

Note: This README provides a high-level overview of the tasks and steps involved in each part. Detailed implementation and code should be provided separately, along with any necessary dependencies, data preprocessing steps, and instructions for running the code.
